                Allahabad Fort is a fort built by the Mughal emperor Akbar at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India in 1583. The fort stands on the banks of the Yamuna near its confluence with the river Ganges. It is recognised by the Archaeological Survey of India as a monument of national importance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Allahabad Fort was constructed by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1583. Abu'l-Fazl, in his Akbarnama writes:<br>
                <i>For a long time [Akbar's] desire was to found a great city in the town of Piyag [Prayag], where the rivers Ganges and Jamna join, and which is regarded by the people of India with much reverence, and which is a place of pilgrimage for the ascetics of that country, and to build a choice fort there.</i>
              </p>
              <p>  
                Akbar's fort was constructed in such a way that it enclosed the famous Akshayavat tree, where people would commit suicide in order to achieve salvation. The reason for this is not known, although some sources claim that he did it to prevent people from committing suicides. According to a local legend, Akbar was a Hindu ascetic named Mukunda Brahmachari in his previous birth. Once, by mistake, he consumed a cow's hair while drinking milk. Horrified at this sin (cow being a holy animal), he committed suicide. He was born a mlechchha (non-Hindu) as a result of this sin, and was driven to build a fort at the holy Sangam.

                Khusro Bagh is a large walled garden and burial complex located in muhalla Khuldabad close to the Prayagraj Junction railway station, in Prayagraj (formerly known as Allahabad), India. It is roughly 6 kms from the Akbar fort built in (r. 1556-1605). Situated over forty acres and shaped as a quadrangle it includes the tombs of Shah Begum (born Manbhawati Bai) (d. 1604), Jahangir's Rajput wife and the daughter of Maharaja Bhagwant Das and Khusrau Mirza's (d. 1622) mother; Khusrau Mirza, Jahangir's eldest son and briefly heir apparent to the Mughal throne; and Nithar Begum (d. 1624), Khusrau Mirza's sister and Jahangir's daughter. It is listed as an Indian Site of National Importance.

              <p>
                The three sandstone mausoleums within this walled garden, present an exquisite example of Mughal architecture The design of its main entrance, the surrounding gardens, and the three-tier tomb of Shah Begum, who died in 1604, has been attributed to Aqa Reza, Jahangir’s principal court artist. Shah Begum, originally Manbhawati Bai, was the daughter of Raja Bhagwant Das of Amber. Distressed by the discord between her husband Jahangir and son Khusrau, she committed suicide in 1604 by swallowing opium. Her tomb was designed in 1606 by Aqa Reza and is a three storied terrace plinth without a main mound, inviting comparisons with Fatehpur Sikri by experts. The tomb however has a large chhatri that surmounts the plinth and the arabesque inscriptions that adorn her tomb were carved out by Mir Abdullah Mushkin Qalam, Jahangir's greatest calligrapher.

                Garhwa fort is a temple complex in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India, belonging to the Gupta Period.The ruins of the temple were fortified in 18th century by Raja Baghel Raja Vikramaditya. The fortification consisted of square enclosure and parapets, giving a fortress kind of look. The temple has many relics belonging to the Gupta period, which date back to as old as 5th and 6th century. The most notable item in the fort is a figure representing all 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu, belonging to 11th or 12th century.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was in the late 18th century that Raja Baghel Raja Vikramaditya of Bara — a tehsil in the Trans-Yamuna region of Uttar Pradesh’s Allahabad district —decided to secure a set of temple ruins at Garhwa. The Raja fortified it with a square enclosure and parapets, which with their fortress-like loopholes bore a military presence. This possibly gave it its present name, Garhwa Fort, though historians have dubbed it a misnomer arguing that the walls of the enclosure were not high enough for defensive purposes.
              </p>
              <p>  
                The Fort, extensively spread over a two-km periphery, is flanked by four bastions. Two fine tanks on the east and a temple with a pillared hall that bears a strong resemblance to the Greek pantheon on the west are its other visible attractions.

                The Allahabad pillar is an Ashoka Stambha, one of the Pillars of Ashoka, erected by Ashoka, Emperor of the Maurya dynasty, who reigned in the 3rd century BCE. While it is one of the few extant pillars that carry his edicts,it is particularly notable for containing later inscriptions attributed to the Gupta emperor Samudragupta (4th century CE).Also engraved on the stone are inscriptions by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, from the 17th century.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point of time, the pillar was moved from its original location and installed within Akbar's Allahabad Fort in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. As the fort is now occupied by the Indian Army, the public are only allowed limited access to the premises and special permission is required to view the pillar.
              </p>
              <p>  
                The Allahabad Pillar is a single shaft of polished sandstone standing 35 feet (10.7 m) high. It has a lower diameter of 35 inches (0.9 m) and an upper diameter of 26 inches (0.7 m). The customary lotiform bell-shaped capital seen in the other Ashoka Pillars is lost as is whichever statue mounted it.
