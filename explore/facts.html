                  <li>The Kumbh Mela takes place every three years, and each year happens at any one of these four locations- Ganga at Haridwar; the meeting of the Ganga and Yamuna and Saraswati at Prayagraj; the Godavari at Nashik: and Shipra at Ujjain</li>
                  <li>On Lord Brahma’s advice, they started churning out the nectar of immortality with the aid of the asuras. However, when the ausras realized that the gods would not be sharing the nectar with the, they chased them for a period of 12 days. It was during this time period that portions of the nectar fell at the four locations where the Kumbh takes place.</li>
                  <li>The Kumbh Mela is over 2000 years old and proof of this is found in the writings of the Chinese traveler Xuanzang, who had come to India during the reign of King Harshavardhana.</li>
                  <li>The Kumbh Mela takes place on the dates when the nectar is said to have fallen in the river. Each year, the dates are calculated depending upon a combination of Jupiter, the Sun and the Moon’s zodiac positions.</li>

            <div id="headingGroup" class="text-white d-none d-lg-block mt-5">
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Was Called Prayag In The Vedic Period.</li>
                  <li>If you have ever been a student of Indian history, then you must have learned that this millenniums-old city was called Prayag before it was named Allahabad by the Mughal King Akbar in the 16th century. But do you know that it was originally known as Kaushambi during the era of the epic Mahabharata?</li>
                  <li>Akbar named it originally as Illahabad. Later, the British changed it to Allahabad. Even in Hindi, the word written is इलाहाबाद .</li>
                  <li>See its a beautiful name. At once, it means the abode of Allah, the God in Islam.</li>
                  <li>But we do not try to see it through other perspective too. Illah is another (ancient) name for Durga too. In Rig veda, there's a line:<br>
                  <i> "Illah Saraswati Mahi tisro Devirmayobhuvaha Varhiha Sidantasridhaha"</i><br>
                  It means O Illah, Saraswati and Mahi, three Goddesses who bring delight, please be seated, peacefully, on the grass.</li>
                  <li>So this tells Illahabad means abode of Illah or the abode of Goddess Durga herself !</li>
                  
                </ul>

              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Many famous writers of Hindi and Urdu literature have a connection with the city. Notable amongst them are Munshi Premchand, Mahadevi Varma, Sumitranandan Pant, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Subhadra Kumari Chauhan, Upendra Nath 'Ashk' and Harivansh Rai Bachchan. This is the literary Hindi heartland. The culture of Allahabad is based on Hindi literature. Maithili Sharan Gupt was also associated with this literary Hindi soil in many ways.</li>
                  <li>The famous English author and Nobel Laureate (1907) Rudyard Kipling spent time at Allahabad working for The Pioneer as an assistant editor and overseas correspondent.</li>
                  <li>Another landmark of the literary past of Allahabad was the publishing firm Kitabistan, owned by the Rehman brothers, Kaleemur Rehman and Obaidur Rehman. They published thousands of books, including those by Nehru. They became the first publishers from India to open a branch in London in 1936.</li>
