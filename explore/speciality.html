                Kumbh Mela or Kumbha Mela is a major pilgrimage and festival in Hinduism.It is celebrated in a cycle of approximately 12 years at four river-bank pilgrimage sites: the Allahabad (Ganges-Yamuna Sarasvati rivers confluence), Haridwar (Ganges), Nashik (Godavari), and Ujjain (Shipra).The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration of community commerce with numerous fairs, education, religious discourses by saints, mass feedings of monks or the poor, and entertainment spectacle.The seekers believe that bathing in these rivers is a means to prāyaścitta (atonement, penance) for past mistakes,and that it cleanses them of their sins.<br><br>
                The festival is traditionally credited to the 8th-century Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara, as a part of his efforts to start major Hindu gatherings for philosophical discussions and debates along with Hindu monasteries across the Indian subcontinent.However, there is no historic literary evidence of these mass pilgrimages were called "Kumbha Mela" prior to the 19th-century. There is ample evidence in historic manuscripts and inscriptions of an annual Magha Mela in Hinduism – with periodic larger gatherings after 6 or 12 years – where pilgrims gathered in massive numbers and where one of the rituals included a sacred dip in a river or holy tank. According to Kama MacLean, the socio-political developments during the colonial era and a reaction to the Orientalism led to the rebranding and remobilisation of the ancient Magha Mela as the modern era Kumbh Mela, particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

                Allahabad is known for its variety of guavas, and the Allahabadi Amrood or red guava tops the chart. So, when you are in the Kumbh Mela, do not forget to grab red guava and eat it raw. They are a powerhouse of nutrients with a divine taste. Relish juicy red guavas and satiate your craving. This is something that you cannot really miss on your pilgrimage to the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.

                From ancient time, University of Allahabad has occupied an esteemed place among the universities of india for over a century now. It has given a numbers of IAS to our nation. A lot of famous alumni are known who build their carrer from this 'oxford of east' .<br><br>

                A.N.Jha Hostel (MUIR Hostel), University of Allahabad known as the ‘factory of IAS' has a best environment for civil preparation. There are also many hostel like Pant hostel, G.N Jha hostel…etc where u will get good environment as well. Now I would like to come to the main point i.e., if you are from hindi medium then this is the best place for your civil preparation throughout the india. Market just near of university 'katra' has all the study materials relevant to civil preparation easily available. Actually, for english medium not a good amount of coaching is available. As far as in university classes of english medium sections are rarely found but hindi medium section have good amount of students as well as professors. The syllabus of Faculty of Arts are so designed that it mostly matches with UPSC CSE syllabus. In university annual examination you will get white(non-ruled) answer sheet to answer which makes a good practice for UPSC aspirants. Attendance is not so much compulsory so that students can focus on their main aim. Department of Psychology, Economics, History, Geography, English, Hindi, Urdu, Philosophy, Pol. Science, Anthropology, Education… etc provides very good faculty of professors as well as nice lectures. <br><br>
                People from numerous states comes Prayagraj for the prepration of SSC, IAS and PCS prepration.

                Allahabad or Prayagraj, may be known for the rivers and the Sangam, temples and the Kumbh, but this historic city is also a treasure trove of flavours. With an extensive spread of sweets, chaats, namkeens, snacks, and possibly the State’s first fine dining restaurant, Allahabad should be on your list for some of the finest flavours that Uttar Pradesh has to offer.
