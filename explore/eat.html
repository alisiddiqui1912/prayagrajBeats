                The brown and delicious balls of goodness and sweet are an epitome of the sweet tooth that Allahabad's cuisine has. The soft and spongy Gulab Jamuns are made from fresh milk and use recipes that have been developed over the years. As the city swears by tradition, so do its food makers and eaters. The resultant sweet is thus fresh, grainy, dense, and yet soft at the same time. While you are here, don't forget to pack some for back home, they are known to retain their taste and flavour over a long time.<br><br>

                No food pilgrimage in Allahabad can ever be complete without a trip to Sainik's in Ashok Nagar that sells the most flavorful and amazing Chhole Samose at Sainik Sweets. The traditional potato-filled samosa is crushed and the spicy chhole are added over it along with curds, some tamarind Chatni,  onions, coriander and sev to make this legendary street food of Allahabad. It can be had a snack or even as a meal by itself. Don't try to pack it home though, the real taste of it lies in the hot steaming samosas and fresh chutneys.<br><br>

As the age-old adage goes, one has to eat them to believe it. These balls of Urad Dal are filled with a spicy and tangy filling that goes perfectly with the Sabzi that they are topped with. The locals and numerous other netizens vouch for Netram Mulchand & Sons as being one of the places to savour local food in Allahabad. The best part about this offering on their menu is that the Kachoris are fried in Pure Desi Ghee, which lends them a flavour that is unique and sumptuous.<br><br>

                Made from thick, creamy, delicious and fresh yoghurt, this Lassi in Allahabad should definitely be on your list of must-haves. The yoghurt is churned to rich buttery goodness until the cream froths up on top. Various sweet and fragrant flavourings are then added to it to impart a stunning and luxurious mouthful. The malai, i.e. cream on top, can be scraped off if you aren't too fond of it but we highly recommend drinking a glassful with the Malai intact. The lassi is mostly served in handmade clay cups that are eco-friendly and instil an earthy taste to the beverage.<br><br>
                Raja Ram Lassi Waalaa is undoubtedly the best place to sample this creamy delicacy! What makes the glassful of goodness here unique, is that it is handmade and has retained its flavour for over 120 years!<br><br>

                A chilly winter morning in Allahabad is often incomplete without a hot cup of tea. There is a stall in the fair that serves tea with a twist. Here, you can have the piping hot tandoori chai served in a kulhad. Sounds interesting, isn't it? What makes this tea different, is the process of making it. Earthen pots or kulhads are roasted in a clay oven at an extreme temperature. Once done, the tea is poured in the pots with some tingling spices. The hot earthen pots add to the unique flavour of the tea and hence the name â€˜tandoori chaiâ€™.

                Nahari at Atala is so much popular now a days, specially in winters.Nihari is a deliciously smooth flour based stew with slow cooked mutton and a myriad of spices. This mutton nihari recipe takes ~4 hours to cook but itâ€™s easy to put together. To get the best flavour, the mutton is cooked on very low heat for upto 4 hours.<br><br>
                Traditionally Nihari was cooked all night and then served to the Mughal Kings of Delhi in breakfast after the morning prayers.

                However, as any Allahabadi will tell you, no one makes it like Nirala ki Chaat. The shop has been making their chaat delicacies for years together and has since become an identifying feature of the Loknath Lane. The best part, however, is that all the items on their menu such as 'Dahi-Sonth ke Batashe', Papdi Chaat, and Phulkis are made from Desi Ghee. This, according to the locals, is what makes all the difference. For a true gastronomic delight, indulging in Allahabadi chaat is a must.<br><br>
